{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:msttvc} is an optional utility command for advanced users.  It is the "halfth" command you would need to run to generate transition probabilities from a Cox model.  Eventually, {cmd:mstsample} 
requires time-varying covariates to be declared using {cmd:stcox}'s {bf:tvc()} and {bf:texp()} options, or else the transition probabilities will be wrong.  
However, there are some instances where the Cox model will take significantly longer to estimate than it would if you manually generated the time-varying covariates yourself.  
This command provides a way to manually estimate the exact same model specification without using {cmd:stcox}'s {bf:tvc()} and {bf:texp()} options.{p_end}

{pstd} You should {ul:only} use this command if:{p_end}
{pmore}(a) {cmd:stcox} is taking a while to run with {bf:tvc()}/{bf:texp()} specified; and{p_end}
{p 8 12 2}(b) you are adept with Cox models, and understand how to {bf:stsplit} data and generate the subsequent interaction terms properly (see Jin and Boehmke 2017).{p_end}

{pstd}To use: {bf:{help stsplit}} the data, manually generate any interactions for time-varying covariates, and then run {cmd:stcox} and include these interactions as regressors at the list's end.
Importantly, **do not include** {bf:tvc()} and {bf:texp()} with the {bf:stcox}, since you have generated and included the time-varying covariates manually.
What you {it:would} have typed for {cmd:stcox}'s {bf:tvc()} and {bf:texp()} is what {bf:msttvc} is expecting in its identically named {bf:tvc()} and {bf:texp()} options.{p_end}

{pstd}We reiterate {bf:msttvc} should be used only when the situation warrants it {it:and} when you know what you are doing.  The command removes some of the proverbial 
safety nets.  {bf:mstsample} implements the proper stsplit and interactions on its own if you can use {bf:stcox, tvc() texp()}.  {cmd:msttvc} overwrites stored results behind the scenes, which will cause downstream problems if the command is
used improperly.{p_end}
